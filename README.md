# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard utilizes the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve current and 5 day forecast weather data based on the city the user enters.

UV index data is color coded based on levels as follows:

- low = 2 or less - coded green
- moderate = 5 or less but above 2 - coded yellow
- high = anything above 5 - coded red

Previously searched cities are saved on the dashboard and can be searched again by clicking their buttons. Doing so removes the button from the dashboard.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for the UI \
Save icon provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) \
[Moment.js API](https://momentjs.com/) was used for date calculation \
